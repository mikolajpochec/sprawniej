# How Sprawniej works

Sprawniej is a web page and nothing else. There is no server of ours. The data lives in a **GitHub repo** that
the team picks: each issue, comment, view and project is a small file there. The page keeps a copy of that repo in
the browser, changes files when you work, and sends the changes to GitHub on its own.

This is the same idea as [peeponote](https://github.com/mikolajpochec/peeponote), our canvas app. Unlike peeponote we
don't run git in the browser: we only ever talk to GitHub, so we use GitHub's API directly. That needs fewer requests
and no special tricks.

## The big picture

```
Browser (Sprawniej, a PWA on GitHub Pages)
  React screens
     |  call
     v
  src/data/actions.ts  (the only code that changes data)
     |-> data store (zustand)              the screen updates at once
     |-> "pending" file in IndexedDB       survives a closed tab or a crash
     '-> save (src/sync/engine.ts)         ~1.5 s later: one commit on GitHub

  every 30 s, on focus, on reconnect:
     "anything new?" -> download changed files -> merge with pending -> store

GitHub repo (for example acme/sprawniej-data) = the workspace
```

## Signing in

- You paste a **classic GitHub token** with the `repo` scope. In the app we call it a "GitHub key".
- The app asks GitHub who you are (`GET /user`) and uses your login, name and picture. That is your account.
  There are no separate passwords.
- The token stays in this browser (localStorage). Signing out removes it.
- People in a workspace are the people GitHub lets in (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/assignees`). Each person also
  writes `people/<login>.json` the first time they open the workspace, so names and pictures work offline.
- Anyone who can push to the repo can change anything. We don't sign files.

### Joining a workspace (teammates)

The owner invites someone by GitHub username from Settings. The app adds them as a collaborator
(`PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/{user}`) and gives back a join link (`#/join/<owner>/<repo>`) with a
ready-to-send message. The link opens a wizard with one step per screen:

1. **Welcome**: what Sprawniej is, in one sentence, with the team's pictures.
2. **GitHub account**: "I have one" or "Create one" (opens github.com/signup).
3. **Accept the invitation**: a button to GitHub's invitation page. The app checks every few seconds and moves on
   by itself once it is accepted.
4. **Make your key**: a button opens GitHub's token page with everything filled in, next to three small
   screenshots (scroll down, press the green button, copy). The pasted key is checked at once, and errors say what
   to do ("This key can't open Acme's workspace yet. Did you accept the invitation in step 3?").
5. **That's you!**: your GitHub picture and name, and "Let's go".

Join links use the app's public address: `VITE_PUBLIC_URL` at build time, or else the address the app is served
from (`src/config.ts`). On localhost there is no link to share, so Settings doesn't show one.

A short tour follows the first visit. The owner's own setup (creating the workspace repo) is a separate, guided path.

### Workspace repositories

Repositories Sprawniej creates are private and named `workspace-sprawniej-<name>` (`src/features/onboarding/repoNames.ts`).
When you choose a workspace, those come first, under *Sprawniej workspaces*; any other repository you can save to is
listed after them and opens fine too. "Invitations for you" only shows invitations to `workspace-sprawniej-` repositories,
so the app never accepts an unrelated GitHub invitation.

## The copy in your browser

Each workspace has its own IndexedDB database (`src/sync/local.ts`) with:

- **base**: every file as it is on GitHub at a known commit,
- **pending**: your changes that haven't reached GitHub yet (a deleted file is stored as nothing),
- **meta**: which commit `base` matches, and the branch.

What you see is base with pending laid on top. The first time you open a workspace, every file is downloaded (100 per
request, through GitHub's GraphQL API). After that only changed files are.

## Saving (there is no Save button)

1. An action updates the store and writes the file to the local repo straight away.
2. After about 1.5 seconds without new changes (or at once when you hide the tab), all pending files go to GitHub as
   one commit with a plain message, such as `ENG-12: In Progress -> Done`. That is three requests: a new tree on top
   of the last known one, a commit, and moving the branch.
   GitHub allows each person about 500 such requests an hour, so a busy hour saves in bigger batches
   (`src/sync/pace.ts`): after 20 saves in the last hour we wait 4 s, after 60 we wait 10 s, after 120 we wait 30 s.
   Hiding the tab still saves at once.
3. Moving the branch refuses to overwrite a teammate's newer save. Then we pull, merge, and try again (up to 4 times).
4. An empty repository can't take a tree yet, so the very first file (`sprawniej.json`) is created through GitHub's
   contents API.
5. Offline, changes keep piling up in pending and go out when you are back online.
6. If GitHub still says "too many requests", the error carries when to come back (`Retry-After`, or the rate limit
   reset). We make no calls until then, and the save chip keeps saying "Saving…" with the time in its tooltip. It is
   not shown as an error, because nothing is lost.

Commits are authored as `Name <id+login@users.noreply.github.com>`, so GitHub shows them as yours.

## Several tabs

The same workspace can be open in many tabs, but only one of them, the **leader**, talks to GitHub and keeps the
browser copy (`src/sync/tabs.ts`). The leader is whichever tab holds a Web Lock named after the workspace. The
others are **followers**:

- On opening, a follower asks the leader for every file over a `BroadcastChannel` and shows them.
- A follower's change shows in that tab at once, then goes to the leader with each file as it was before and after.
  If the leader's version moved on in the meantime (a teammate's change arrived), the leader merges them by the
  usual rules. Until the leader confirms, the follower keeps showing its own version of those files.
- The leader sends every changed file (yours, other tabs', teammates') and its save chip to all followers.
- When a follower gets focus or is hidden, it asks the leader to check GitHub or to save now.
- When the leader tab closes, the next tab in line gets the lock, loads the browser copy, sends again whatever the
  old leader hadn't confirmed, and carries on. Followers then send it anything still unconfirmed.
- Signing out or entering a new GitHub key in one tab restarts the others.

So ten open tabs cost GitHub as much as one, and two tabs never race each other to save. A browser without Web
Locks lets every tab lead on its own.

## Getting other people's changes

The leader checks GitHub every 30 seconds while any tab of the workspace is visible, when the tab gets focus, and when the network comes
back. The check asks for the branch with an ETag, so "nothing changed" doesn't use up GitHub's rate limit. When the
branch moved, GitHub's compare API lists the changed files (if it can't, for example after a rewritten history, we
compare whole file lists by their git ids). We download only those, merge them with pending, and update the screen
before anything else runs, so your next edit starts from the merged version.

## Merge rules: nobody ever sees a conflict

Two people working at the same time must never be asked to choose between versions. Most things are separate
files with a single writer, so they can't clash at all. Where two people can touch the same file, the app merges
field by field, and when they changed the very same field the later save wins, exactly what a normal app with a
server does. The code is `src/sync/merge.ts` (`mergeIncoming`), and every row below has a test in
`tests/merge.test.ts`.

| What two people do at the same time | What happens | Notice? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Comment on the same issue | Both comments appear (one file per comment) | No |
| Edit different fields of one issue (status, assignee…) | Both changes stay | No |
| Change the same field of one issue | The later save wins | No |
| Add or remove labels on one issue | Both sides' additions and removals apply | No |
| Edit different parts of a description | Lines merge | No |
| Rewrite the same lines of a description | The later save's lines win; the other version stays in GitHub history | Yes, a small one, because text disappeared |
| Edit one view (filters, emoji, layout…) | Field by field; filter lists merge like labels | No |
| Edit one project, team, label or the workspace name | Field by field; the same field: later save wins | No |
| Join or leave the same team | Membership lists merge | No |
| Create issues | Separate files; if both got the same number while offline, the one not yet saved takes the next number | Yes, because the number changed ("ENG-12 is now ENG-14") |
| One deletes an issue, the other edits it | The edit wins and the issue stays | No |
| One moves an issue to another team, the other edits it | One issue, in the new team, with the edit | No |
| Mark inbox items as read on two devices | Read lists merge | No |
| Drag issues around | Each drag rewrites only the moved issue; the same issue: later drop wins | No |

"Later save" means whoever's changes reach GitHub second. Someone who was offline for an hour and then comes back
counts as later, just as their request would arrive later at a server.

## Ordering and drag-n-drop

Each issue has a `sortOrder` string made with [fractional-indexing](https://github.com/rocicorp/fractional-indexing).
Dropping an issue between two others gives it a key between theirs (`src/data/ordering.ts`), so only the moved
issue's file changes, and two people reordering at once never clash. List and board use the same order. Dropping
into another column or group also changes that field (status, assignee, priority or project), in the same change.

Dragging is done with dnd-kit (`src/features/issues/useIssueDrag.ts`). While you drag, the order on screen is local
state; nothing is written until you drop. In a list, sub-issues sit under their parent, so a dropped issue gets its
key from the nearest issues at its own level (top-level issues among top-level ones, sub-issues among their
siblings). Reordering only means something in Manual order; under another ordering a drop can still change the
group, and otherwise we explain where to switch to Manual.

How a built-in page looks (grouping, ordering, what's hidden) is personal: it's kept in this browser per page
(`src/data/displays.ts`), never in the workspace. Filters set on a built-in page are personal too and last until you
leave the page. A saved view is different: its filters and display live in `views/<id>.json`, so changing them on
the view's page changes the view for everyone. Two people changing different filters at once both keep theirs
(filter lists merge as sets, see the merge rules).

## Code layout

| Folder | What's inside |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app` | The frame (sidebar, top bar), routes, the save chip |
| `src/model` | File schemas (zod) and the fixed statuses and priorities |
| `src/data` | The store, pure selectors (filter, group, sort), `actions.ts`, the save queue |
| `src/github` | Every call to GitHub (REST and GraphQL), with errors in plain words |
| `src/sync` | The browser copy, the save and pull loop, merging, renumbering, save pacing, the leading tab |
| `src/session.ts` | Who is signed in, which workspace is open (localStorage) |
| `src/features/onboarding` | Sign-in, the join wizard, choosing and creating workspaces |
| `src/features/*` | Screens, one folder per area (issues, views, projects, inbox, import, help…) |
| `src/components` | Small shared pieces (avatar, empty state, segmented switch) |
| `src/ui` | shadcn/ui components |
| `tests` | `bun test` for the pure logic |

Routes use the URL hash (`#/team/ENG/issues/active`, `#/issue/ENG-12`) because GitHub Pages serves a single file.

## Keeping it fast

- The store keeps a separate object per kind of thing. Applying changed files copies only the kinds they touch, so
  a label change doesn't redraw issue lists.
- Sub-issue counters come from one index per version of the issues (`childIndex` in `src/data/select.ts`), not a
  scan per row.
- The issue title saves a moment after you stop typing, not on every key.
- The editor and the Markdown formatter load on their own, after the rest of the app (the editor a moment after the
  workspace opens). Code blocks colour a short list of languages (`src/editor/languages.ts`).
